            <p>I don't like tacos</p>

            <p>They aren't really good</p>

            <p>They don't have enough meat</p>

            <p>I don't like tacos</p>

            <p>I want a real taco</p>

            <p>That's how I think about you</p>

            <p>I don't like you</p>

            <p>You're not very tasty</p>

            <p>I don't like you</p>

            <p>I don't like you</p>

            <p>You're too bland</p>

            <p>I don't like you</p>

            <p>I don't like you</p>

            <p>You're not that cool</p>

            <p>I don't like you</p>

            <p>I don't like you</p>

            <p>I'd rather eat some olives</p>

            <p class="italic">Here's lyrics for a song about tacos:</p>

            <p>You can tell I'm a taco,</p>

            <p>Spanish is my game.</p>

            <p>Don't call me Mexican,</p>

            <p>Call me taco, taco, taco!</p>

            <p>I make my own rules,</p>

            <p>I work for the taco truck,</p>

            <p>Shake the hand of the taco,</p>

            <p>Tell the truth to the taco.</p>

            <p>I'm the taco, taco, taco,</p>

            <p>I'm the taco, taco, taco,</p>

            <p>I'm the taco, taco, taco,</p>

            <p>Ohhhh. Taco. Taco. Taco.</p>

            <p>Taco, taco, taco,</p>

            <p>Taco, taco, taco,</p>

            <p>Taco, taco, taco,</p>

            <p>Ohhhh. Taco. Taco. Taco.</p>

            <p>
              If you wanted to make a song that looks like a song about tacos,
              it would go like this.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then you would have a song about tacos, and the taco would be the
              star of the show. And the taco would be the center of the
              universe. And that's the way it should be.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because, really, there is no way that the taco could be the center
              of the universe. The taco is too small. And it's always flinging
              tacos at us.
